%p Here's what some colleagues say about me:
%p.quote
  "Mo Zhu is a highly sought after, whip smart Rails developer ... Not only does he write readable, well tested, and efficient code, but he does so in what seems like no time at all ... On one project, after he completed the server, he began learning Swift, and is now substantially contributing on the iOS side of things as well. Could not recommend him higher."

  "Mo worked promptly and diligently to deliver a high-quality product that to date has worked magnificently. There is no question that this would not have been possible without having Mo on the team. Unlike other developers out there, Mo does not operate in a transactional manner - he is truly invested in the project, asks insightful questions and seeks to understand the bigger problem that he is working to solve."
